<h3 id="qbb">3) Quick Bread Buns</h3>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>250g strong white flour
<br>5ml (level) spoon salt (provided)
<br>1 sachet of dried yeast (provide)
<br>150ml warm water (at school)
<br>15ml oil (provided
<br>5ml (level) spoon sugar (provided)
</p>

<h4>Equipment</h4>
<p>Weighing scale
<br>Sieve
<br>Mixxing bowl
<br>Measuring spoons
<br>Measuring jug
<br>Wooden mixxing spoon
<br>Greased baking tray
</p>

<h4>Method</h4>
 <p>1) Preheat the oven 220 °C or gas mark 7.
   <br>
<br>2) Collect ingredients and equipment. Weigh out ingredients.
It is vital that the weighing is accurate. Liquid measurement in particular.
<br>
<br>3) Put flour and salt into bowl. Add the sugar. Mix ingredients together with a wooden spoon.
Disperse ingredients throughout mixture. Salt strengthens the gluten but take
care, it can destroy the yeast. Gluten forms the framework of the bread.
<br>
<br>4) Add yeast and stir.
Use quick acting dried yeast, it reduces the proving time and is almost fool
proof. Any additions, such as sundried tomatoes, cheese, dried fruit, should be
added at this point.
<br>
<br>5) Add oil to warm liquid (150ml) and add enough to flour mixture to make a soft
dough. Mix with a spoon at first and then use one hand to bring together as a
dough. Use the other hand to hold onto the bowl.
Any added fat gives a richer dough, can extend the shelf life, but can also slow
down fermentation. If a very quick product is required, the oil can be omitted.
Bring the ingredients together by hand, feel what is happening. The dough must
be soft but not sticky. The water should be quite warm (37C) for the quickest
rise.
<br>
<br>6) Knead the dough firmly for ten minutes.
This makes the gluten (protein) elastic. The dough will become stretchy. The kneading action also distributes the yeast evenly throughout the mixture.
<br>
<br>7) Cut the dough into six equal pieces. Shape each into a bread shape and
arrange in the lightly greased tray.
In industry, it is essential that each roll is the same weight, if not the consumer
will not be satisfied and in the cooking process some will cook quicker than
others.
<br>
<br>8) Place in the top oven/grill area. The main oven will be preheating and as hot
air rises the top oven/grill area will be warm.
In the warm temperature the bread shapes rise and the mixture grows in size.
This is a shortened proving but it does work. Traditionally, the dough would be
covered in a large polythene bag and left to rise until doubled in size.
<br>
<br>9) Place in the main oven and bake for 10-15 minutes until golden brown.
The high cooking temperature destroys the yeast and expands the gas.
Traditionally, the temperature is reduced to allow time for the gluten to set, to
allow the starch to absorb the liquid and to create the colour of the crust
(dextrinization).
<br>
<br>10) Test for readiness by tapping the bottom. It should sound hollow.
Indicates gluten framework is set.
<br>
<br>11) Allow to cool.
This allows the moisture to evaporate and avoids a soggy product.
  </p>

<h4>Top Tips</h4>
<p>
<span>
<ul>
  <li>Add chopped nuts, seeds, diced fresh fruit, vegetables, or chopped dried fruit before you add the liquid ingredients.</li>
  <li>Form the dough into a variety of shapes such as; knots, small cottage loaves, sticks, twists, or plaits.</li>
  <li>Use egg yolk, egg white, or a mixute of both for different glazed finishes on the bread buns.</li>
</ul>
